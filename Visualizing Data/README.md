In the next lab, we will start looking into how to take action on the information your microprocessor is receiving, for the last part of this lab, we will focus on visualizing the data. We will focus on three main methods of visualization. For each of these methods, you need to pick between 1-3 processors based on the part. As with Milestone 1, you will need to talk in this README about why you picked the processors you did (for one part, it is going to be painfully obvious). Overall, you should aim to use all five processors by the end of this part of the lab, however _YOU DO NOT NEED TO USE ALL FIVE FOR EACH PART_.
