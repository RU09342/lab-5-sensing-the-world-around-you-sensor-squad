One of the biggest limitations of the microcontroller is the fact that it lives in a digital world. We need certain components to be able to translate the analog world to the digital world and vice-versa. In this lab, we need to be able to convert some electrical phenomena into something our microcontroller can understand. For this, we need a few building blocks to do this.

## Sensors Used
* Photoresistor
* Phototransistor
* Thermoregulator

* Voltage
* Current
* Resistance

## ADC10

## ADC12

### Hardware
The hardware portion should be the same for each of the processors. You will need to have a total of 3 circuits made, each corresponding to a different sensor. You need to look at the range of measurements and the amount of resolution you can get out of your ADC and determine how to convert, scale, and filter your signal. Don't forget the fact that you will need to convert to a voltage, making some of these circuits not so trivial. The main goal as the hardware designer for these sensors is to provide the microprocessor with the best resolution to maximize the effectiveness of the ADC.
